# Super Computer Modeling at Worcester Polytechnic Institute - Featuring Epidemic & Whale Migration Simulation
<h3 align="center">Epidemic, By Alexander Dejeu and Nathan Oldakowskit</h3>
---

As high school seniors at the Massachusetts Academy of Math and Science we worked together with Dr. Olson at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) to create different computer models and learn how to run the programs on WPIâ€™s super computer.  As we concluded our work we decided to share what we created and learned.  Below you will find two of our favorite simulations with demonstrations and descriptions.  We encourage you build upon our work or just check it out.  Lastly, we would love to thank Dr. Olson and Worcester Polytechnic Institute for enabling this endeavor.

### What is the Epidemic Simulation?
<i>Epidemic Simulation</i> is a random walk model for how quickly an epidemic can spread.  In our simulation there is a set population with an incredibly small portion being infected. Then each step every person - represented by a dot - moves by some random direction and limited distance. Then if a healthy person is near an infected person there is a small chance he or she will be infected.  Additionally, for each step there is a chance an infected person will die or will become cured from the sickness.

This entire project is made using MatLab :)  You can find more information about how functions and what not work right in the code!

<h3 align="center">Made to demonstrate theory but also kick start your random walk </h3>

Really great example of a random walk.  Take it!  Learn from it, expand on it, and make some cool projects <3

<h3 align="center">How to use and implement</h3>
* Steps
   * Download or clone
   * Run
   * Learn From
   * Expand :)

### Quickly Analyse Situation:

### What you are seeing:
Above you are watching a one year simululation of a disease spreading.  There is a starting population, a starting sick population and then as time passes everyone moves and there is a chance of the disease spreading to someone else and someone who is sick becoming curing.
