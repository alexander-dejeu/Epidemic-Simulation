New SESA (Scientific and Engineering Software Applications) training sessions have been posted on web at: http://www.wpi.edu/webapps/regi/sesa.html .
 
*** Introduction to LABVIEW
March 25, 3:00pm, March 27, 2:00pm, HL234
 
*** MATLAB Crash Course
Lecture 1:   March 23, 12:00pm, March 24, 6:00pm, HL234
Lecture 2:  March 25, 12:00pm, March 26, 6:00pm, HL234
Lecture 3:  March 30, 12:00pm, March 31, 6:00pm, HL234
Lecture 4:  April 1, 12:00pm, April 2, 6:00pm, HL234
 
We offer the Matlab Crash Course in a new format: four lectures and more examples and hands-on exercises. The following topics will be covered:
Lectures 1 and 2: Basics of Matlab
Lecture 3: Structures, 3D plots, Contours and field plots, Solving ordinary differential equations
Lecture 4: Animations, Symbolic calculations .

I've been learning how to submit jobs and use Matlab, as well as work on some 'pet problems', which have mostly been about calculating pi.

I can send you all of the files that I have if you want them! Now that I think about it, you probably have them in the dropbox, but there might be a few missing.

This entire project is made using MatLab :)  You can find more information about how functions and what not work right in the code!

<h3 align="center">Made To....Be put right on device?</h3>

At this point we know you must be thking how useful and cool this technology is!  Likely you want to give it a try, lucky for you both simulations are available.
